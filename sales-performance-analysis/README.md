# Sales Performance Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to understand sales trends, profitability, and the impact of discounting on business performance. The analysis focuses on identifying actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Dataset
Global retail sales dataset containing order details, customer segments, product categories, sales, discounts, and profit information.

## Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL) – Data cleaning and analysis
- Microsoft Excel – Pivot tables, charts, and reporting

## Analysis Performed
- Regional sales analysis to identify high- and low-performing regions
- Profit margin analysis across product categories
- Discount bucket analysis to evaluate the impact of discounts on profitability
- Year-over-year sales growth analysis using SQL window functions

## Key Visualizations

### Sales by Region
Shows total sales distribution across different regions.

### Profit Margin by Category
Highlights profitability differences between product categories.

### Discount vs Profit
Demonstrates how increasing discount levels negatively affect profit.

### Year-over-Year Sales Growth
Illustrates business growth trends and recovery over time.

## Key Insights
- High sales volume does not always translate into high profit.
- Technology products generate the highest margins.
- Medium and high discounts consistently lead to losses.
- Sales growth shows a positive trend after an initial decline.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that profitability is driven more by pricing and discount strategies than by sales volume alone. Optimizing discount policies and focusing on high-margin categories can significantly improve overall business performance.
